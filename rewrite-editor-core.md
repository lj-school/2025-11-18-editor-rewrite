## Collaboration

Collaboration can be either implemented by using operational transformation (OT)
or conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs). However, there seem to be better
library support for CRDTs than for OT.

### CRDT Libraries

- [Yjs](https://yjs.dev/) for general-purpose CRDTs.
  - Integrations for ProseMirror, TipTap, CodeMirror, Quill, and others.
- [Loro](htts://loro.dev/) – seems to be a newer alternative to Yjs.

### OT Libraries

- [OT types](https://github.com/ottypes)
  - [json1](https://github.com/ottypes/json1) for JSON documents.
  - [rich-text](https://github.com/ottypes/rich-text) for rich text documents
    (Quill Delta format).
- [ShareDB](https://share.github.io/sharedb/) for central server architecture.

##### Notes

- API seems to be similar to CRDT libraries so that switching between OT and
  CRDT might be possible. However, editor bindings for ProseMirror & Co might be
  missing.
- Libraries seem to be less actively maintained than CRDT libraries.
